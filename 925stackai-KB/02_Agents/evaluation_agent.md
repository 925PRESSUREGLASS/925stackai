# Evaluation Agent

Performs self-assessment and testing of the 925stackai system to ensure quality and reliability.

## Overview

The Evaluation Agent provides automated testing, quality assessment, and performance monitoring capabilities. It validates system responses, tests edge cases, and provides metrics for continuous improvement of the quoting system.

## Core Functions

### Automated Testing

Runs comprehensive test suites against the system:

```python
def run_evaluation_suite(self):
    test_results = {
        'quote_accuracy': self.test_quote_calculations(),
        'response_quality': self.test_response_generation(),
        'memory_persistence': self.test_memory_operations(),
        'error_handling': self.test_error_scenarios()
    }
    
    return self.generate_evaluation_report(test_results)
```

### Quote Validation

Ensures pricing calculations are accurate and consistent:

- Validates against known test cases
- Checks mathematical accuracy of calculations
- Verifies proper application of surcharges and discounts
- Tests edge cases and boundary conditions

### Response Quality Assessment

Evaluates the quality of AI-generated responses:

```python
def assess_response_quality(self, user_input: str, agent_response: str) -> dict:
    metrics = {
        'relevance': self.score_relevance(user_input, agent_response),
        'completeness': self.check_completeness(agent_response),
        'accuracy': self.verify_factual_accuracy(agent_response),
        'clarity': self.assess_clarity(agent_response)
    }
    
    return {
        'overall_score': sum(metrics.values()) / len(metrics),
        'detailed_scores': metrics,
        'improvement_suggestions': self.generate_suggestions(metrics)
    }
```

## Test Scenarios

### Standard Quote Tests

Validates common quoting scenarios:

- Single-story residential properties
- Multi-story homes with mixed window types
- Commercial buildings with large windows
- Properties with travel charges

### Edge Case Testing

Tests system behavior in unusual situations:

- Minimum charge applications
- Maximum surcharge combinations
- Invalid or incomplete user inputs
- System unavailability scenarios

### Performance Testing

Monitors system performance under various loads:

```python
def performance_test(self, concurrent_users: int, duration_minutes: int):
    start_time = time.time()
    results = []
    
    for i in range(concurrent_users):
        thread = threading.Thread(
            target=self.simulate_user_session,
            args=(duration_minutes,)
        )
        thread.start()
    
    # Monitor response times, memory usage, error rates
    return self.analyze_performance_metrics(results)
```

## Quality Metrics

### Accuracy Measurements

- Quote calculation precision (target: 100% mathematical accuracy)
- Price structure compliance (target: 100% rule adherence)
- Memory retrieval accuracy (target: >95% relevant context)

### User Experience Metrics

- Response time (target: <2 seconds for simple quotes)
- Conversation flow effectiveness
- Error recovery success rate
- User satisfaction indicators

### System Reliability

- Uptime monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Memory consumption analysis
- Agent availability status

### A/B Testing Support

Enables testing of system improvements:

```python
def ab_test_configuration(self, variant_a: dict, variant_b: dict, test_duration: int):
    # Split traffic between variants
    # Measure performance differences
    # Provide statistical significance analysis
    pass
```

## Developer Tools
